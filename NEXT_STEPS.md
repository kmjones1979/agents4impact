# ðŸš€ Your Next Steps

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your project is now set up. Here's what to do next:

---

## Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Copy the key (starts with `AIza...`)

---

## Step 2: Authenticate with Google Cloud

Run these commands (no service account key needed!):

```bash
# Install gcloud CLI (if not installed)
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Login to Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Set your project (replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID)
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Setup Application Default Credentials
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**Note**: This works even though service account key creation is disabled in your org!

---

## Step 3: Edit Your .env File

Open `.env` and add your credentials:

```bash
# Open in your default editor
nano .env

# Or use VS Code
code .env

# Or use vim
vim .env
```

Add these lines:
```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-actual-project-id
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...your-actual-api-key
```

Save the file.

---

## Step 4: Start the Agents

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start all agents
./scripts/start_all_agents.sh
```

You should see:
```
Orchestrator:    http://localhost:8000
BigQuery Agent:  http://localhost:8001  
Ticket Agent:    http://localhost:8002
Maps Agent:      http://localhost:8003
```

---

## Step 5: Test It Out

```bash
# Run the example client
python client_example.py

# Or visit the API docs
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```
